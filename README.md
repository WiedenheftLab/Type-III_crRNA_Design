# Type-III_crRNA_Design
Custom R-scrpit and associated files to find Type III crRNA sequences that are conserved in SARS-CoV-2 genomes [From Santiago-Frangos et al. 2021 *Cell Reports Medicine*].
* crRNAs should be able to target diverse SARS-CoV-2 genotypes
* crRNAs should not cross-react with human mRNAs or other common respiratory flora
